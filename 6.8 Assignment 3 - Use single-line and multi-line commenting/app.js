// Assignment 6.8: Use single-line and multi-line commenting.

// Describe the new section of our code, turn off and on lines of code, and leave a note to yourself for later - all using the comment syntax.

// Tasks:
//     List your name, your birthday, the name of your favorite pet, and the city you would love to travel to next.
//     Give it “a heading” “Personal Info” as a comment.
//     Practice commenting-out lines of code by “turning off” your new third line - the one with your pet’s name. Then, re-run your file to confirm that the line no longer runs!
//     Turn off this entire section of code:
//         First, un-comment the line with your pet’s information (so that it’s turned back on) .
//         Second, use multi-line commenting to turn off all four new lines.
//     Add an earlier note to yourself that is adjacent to your code, using in-line commenting.

// Solution:

// Personal Info
/* console.log("My name is Farah Syed"); // Inline Comment
console.log("My birthday is on January 1, 1990");
console.log("My favorite pet is Tommy");
console.log("I would love to travel Seoul next"); */
